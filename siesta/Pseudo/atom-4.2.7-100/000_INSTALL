* This is the first modern version of ATOM that is made available
(to academic users only) separately from Siesta.

To compile it, you need the xmlf90 and libGridXC libraries, which can
be downloaded from Launchpad:

http://launchpad.net/libgridxc
http://launchpad.net/xmlf90

** Steps in detail

- Prepare an arch.make file in the main directory of the ATOM distribution.
  Look at arch.make.sample for inspiration.

- Dowload and unpack the library tarballs:
   ( Use the appropriate latest versions from Launchpad )

  tar xzvf xmlf90-1.5.3.tgz
  tar xzvf libgridxc-0.8.0.tgz   

- Compile the libGridXC and xmlf90 libraries (follow the instructions
  in the appropriate packages). You can optionally compile libGridXC with
  libxc support.

- Go back to the ATOM top directory and review the settings of the
  xmlf90 and libGridXC import lines. For example:

include $(XMLF90_ROOT)/share/org.siesta-project/xmlf90.mk
include $(GRIDXC_ROOT)/gridxc.mk

  NOTE: The building mechanism for Siesta-related libraries is still
  being refined. The above paths below $(XMLF90_ROOT) and $(GRIDXC_ROOT)
  might change with different versions of the libraries. Check their
  installation trees and use the appropriate path to the .mk file.
  
- Type

    make

  to compile the program.
