  abstract  = {Nanosize pores in graphene can make its electronic properties more favorable for transistor applications and may also be useful for molecular separations. Moreno et al. used Ullmann coupling to polymerize a dibromo-substituted diphenylbianthracene on a gold surface (see the Perspective by Sinitskii). Cyclodehydrogenation of the resulting polymer produced graphene nanoribbons, and cross-coupling of these structures created a nanoporous graphene sheet with pore sizes of about 1 nanometer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic structure in which semiconductor bands with an energy gap of 1 electron volt coexist with localized states created by the pores.Science, this issue p. 199; see also p. 154Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic graphene into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of \~{}1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.},

Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Graphene nanoribbons-narrow and straight-edged stripes of graphene, or single-layer graphite-are predicted to exhibit electronic properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices. In particular, although the two-dimensional parent material graphene exhibits semimetallic behaviour, quantum confinement and edge effects should render all graphene nanoribbons with widths smaller than 10 nm semiconducting. But exploring the potential of graphene nanoribbons is hampered by their limited availability: although they have been made using chemical, sonochemical and lithographic methods as well as through the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, the reliable production of graphene nanoribbons smaller than 10 nm with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple method for the production of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons of different topologies and widths, which uses surface-assisted coupling of molecular precursors into linear polyphenylenes and their subsequent cyclodehydrogenation. The topology, width and edge periphery of the graphene nanoribbon products are defined by the structure of the precursor monomers, which can be designed to give access to a wide range of different graphene nanoribbons. We expect that our bottom-up approach to the atomically precise fabrication of graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations of the properties of this exciting class of materials. It should even provide a route to graphene nanoribbon structures with engineered chemical and electronic properties, including the theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots, superlattice structures and magnetic devices based on specific graphene nanoribbon edge states.},

  abstract  = {Controllable manipulation of surface plasmon polaritons in discrete waveguide arrays is critical in plasmonic applications. In this paper, exploiting the coupled-mode theory with the tight-binding approximation, the discrete plasmonic Talbot effect in the weak coupled single-mode graphene ribbon arrays is investigated. The Talbot distance can be flexible, modulated by the changing parameters (i.e., the carrier doping or array periods) of the graphene ribbon arrays, and the significant subwavelength Talbot distances (\&\#x03BB;/13) are obtained. In the configuration, the coupled-mode theory with the tight-binding approximation is proved intensely efficient to describe the propagation of surface plasmon supermodes. Thus, our analysis can open a new avenue for developing graphene-based imaging devices and pave a way for their potential applications.},

The Talbot effect occurs only when the incident field has a pattern with a few selected periods. The Talbot distance is found to decrease exponentially with the decreasing period of the MGSA and can be as small as 1/20 of the incident wavelength. In addition, the Talbot distance can be further reduced by increasing the chemical potential of graphene or operating at longer wavelengths.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the last decade, on-surface fabricated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have gathered enormous attention due to their semiconducting π-conjugated nature and atomically precise structure. A significant breakthrough is the recent fabrication of nanoporous graphene (NPG) as a 2D array of laterally bonded GNRs. This covalent integration of GNRs could enable complex electronic functionality at the nanoscale; however, for that, it is crucial to externally control the electronic coupling between GNRs within NPGs, which, to date, has not been possible. Using quantum chemical calculations and large-scale transport simulations, this study demonstrates that such control is enabled in a newly designed quinone-NPG (q-NPG) thanks to its GNRs inter-connections based on electroactive para-benzoquinone units. As a result, the spatial distribution of injected currents in q-NPG may be tuned, with sub-nanometer precision, via the application of external electrostatic gates and electrochemical means. These results thus provide a fundamental strategy to design organic nanodevices with built-in externally tunable electronics and spintronics, which is key for future applications such as bio-chemical nanosensing and carbon nanoelectronics.},

  abstract  = {Graphene nanoribbons hold great promise for future applications in nanoelectronic devices{,} as they may combine the excellent electronic properties of graphene with the opening of an electronic band gap – not present in graphene but required for transistor applications. With a two-step on-surface synthesis process{,} graphene nanoribbons can be fabricated with atomic precision{,} allowing precise control over width and edge structure. Meanwhile{,} a decade of research has resulted in a plethora of graphene nanoribbons having various structural and electronic properties. This article reviews not only the on-surface synthesis of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons but also how their electronic properties are ultimately linked to their structure. Current knowledge and considerations with respect to precursor design{,} which eventually determines the final (electronic) structure{,} are summarized. Special attention is dedicated to the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons{,} also in dependence on their width and edge structure. It is exactly this possibility of precisely changing their properties by fine-tuning the precursor design – offering tunability over a wide range – which has generated this vast research interest{,} also in view of future applications. Thus{,} selected device prototypes are presented as well.},
